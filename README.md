# Toxicity Classification
## Objective
Build toxicity classification model to demonstarte transfer learning, custom-built model, improvement strategies and the relevant NLP and deep learning techniques.
## Introduction
The tocicity classification is a common NLP problem. A toxicity dataset is available in Tensorflow. It is a problem easy to understand and sufficient to demonstrate certain key NLP and Deep Learning techniques, including but not limitted to transfer learning, text embedding, and neural network architectures. We will build transfer learning model and custom-built models. Interesting performances will be shown but our focus will be more on the model architectures. The model architecutres presented here will not only be applicable to this problem, but also have a wide range of applications, which we will discuss in the end.
## Outline
1. Data and problem description.
2. Use Tensorflow's pretrained to train a toxicity classification model with the Tensorflow NLP dataset.
3. Build a basic model from scratch and compare the performance.
4. Propose a improvement strategy, build the model and compare the performance.
5. Discussion - Application & Improvement.
